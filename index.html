We are a company of Christians from many backgrounds and many walks of life with one essential theme in common...we have all come to know God&#39;s Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, as our own personal Saviour and Lord. We know for certain, on the basis of God&#39;s Word (the Holy Bible), that our sins are forgiven, that we will be in heaven at the end of life&#39;s journey and we know the Lord Jesus now as our companion and friend along the way. What did we do to deserve all this?! Absolutely nothing!!! We are living in the personal, joyful confidence that <strong> &quot;the Son of God loved me, and gave Himself for me&quot;</strong> We believe that God has good news in Jesus Christ for fallen man. Jesus said in Luke 19:10 <strong>&quot;For The son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.&quot;</strong> </p> </div> </div> <nav> <ul> <li><a href="#more">More</a></li> <li><a href="#beliefs">Beliefs</a></li> <li><a href="#location">Location</a></li> <li><a href="#schedule">Schedule</a></li> <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li> <li><a href="#predications">Predications</a></li> <li><a href="indexfr.html">Français</a></li> </ul> </nav> </header> <!-- Main --> <div id="main"> <!-- More --> <article id="more"> <h2 class="major">More</h2> Our meetings are conducted in an orderly fashion with reverence to God.

(Deut. 6:6; Josh. 1:81; Psa. 19:7-11; Psa. 119:9, 30, 98, 99, 105; Jer. 23:28-29; Rom. 15:4). </p><h4>The God-Head</h4><p> We believe in one God (Deut. 4:35-39; Isa. 45:5-21; 1 Cor. 8:4-6) eternally existing in three persons - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 1:4-6) - the same in substance, equal in power and glory. </p><h4>Christ’s Perfect Manhood</h4><p> We believe in the whole incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ (John 1:14), whoever was the &quot;only begotten ” Son of God, the eternal “Word” that was with God, and was God (John 1:1; Mic. 5:2) but who, that He might do the will of his Father, condescended to become man (Phil. 2:5-9), being sinlessly begotten of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the virgin Mary (Luke 1:35), and of her brought into the world (Luke 2:11; Gal. 4:4-5); very God yet truly man (1 Tim. 3:1 6; 1 John 5:20). </p><h4>The Holy Spirit</h4><p> We believe in the Personality of the Holy Spirit of God - the third person in the Trinity (Matt. 28:19; 1 Cor. 2:9-11; 1 Cor. 12:11); and that it is He who quickens into life (John 6:63); and regenerates the sinner (John 3:5); making him a child of God through faith in Christ Jesus (Gal. 3:26); producing in him the fruits of righteousness, as manifested in a changed manner of life,-- “old things passed away&quot;, “all things become new ” 2 Cor. 5:17). </p><h4>Creation and Fall of Man</h4><p> We believe that man was created by God in His own image and likeness, a perfect specimen of manhood, and not &quot;evolved &quot;from some lower forms of life (Gen. 1:26-27). Through disobedience to the command of God, he fell from his high estate, and became a sinner in nature and by practice (Gen. 2:1 7; 3:1 -7; Rom. 5:12). Because of this, also, he became alienated from God and &quot;dead in trespasses and in sins” (Rom. 3:9-19; Col. 1:21; Eph. 2:1-3). </p><h4>The Death of Christ </h4><p> We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died as a substitutionary Sacrifice for our sins (Rom. 5:6-8; 1 Cor. 15:3-4; 1 Peter 3:18); satisfying the demands of God’s holy Law against us as sinners, and putting away sin by the sacrifice of Himself (Heb. 9:24-26; 10:4- 14), He made it possible for God to be just and yet be the Justifier of all who believe in the Lord Jesus as their own personal Savior (Rom. 3:24-26). Therefore, because of the value that God &#39;s Word attaches to the finished work of Christ on Calvary &#39;s Cross, the sinner who believes is now eternally saved from the penalty of his sin (John 19:30; Acts 13:39-41; Heb. 5:9), not on the ground of his prayers and works, but alone through the blood of Christ (Eph. 2:8-9). Good works are the fruit of salvation, -- the “things that accompany” it (Heb. 6:9); God’s purpose being that His people should be “Zealous of good works&quot;, and “careful to maintain&quot; them (Titus 2:14; 3:8). </p><h4>The Resurrection and Enthronement of Christ</h4><p> We believe in the resurrection of the crucified body of the Lord Jesus Christ. Of this He gave indisputable evidence, appearing unto many, and companying with them for a period of forty days after the resurrection (Luke 24:1-32; John 20:19-29; 1 Cor. 15: 3-9; Acts 1:3). Then He, in the presence of credible witnesses, ascended up to Heaven (Acts 1:7), where He is now enthroned at the Father&#39;s right hand and engaged for us as our Advocate and Great High Priest; ever living in the presence of God to make intercession for us (Heb. 1:1-3; 1 John 2:1-2; Heb. 4:14-16; Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25). </p><h4>The Local Church or Assembly</h4><p> We believe in the truth of the local church or assembly as God &#39;s testimony on earth during this age; that it is a local company of believers gathered unto the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, baptized by immersion and believing and practicing the apostles doctrine, that is, all the New Testament teachings. (Acts 2:41-42). The purity of the assembly must be maintained and when moral or doctrinal evil is committed or practiced the guilty person must be put away (excommunicated), in order that the glory of God may be maintained and the erring one put outside the local church where the restoring grace of God can reach him. (1 Cor. 5:13; 2 Cor. 2:3-8) Reception of a Christian into the fellowship and exercise of the privileges and responsibilities of the local Church is by either of two ways: (1) after personal interview with the elders to determine the moral, spiritual and doctrinal fitness of the individual and announcement of the individual’s name to the whole assembly, or, (2) by verbal or written commendation giving assurance that an individual already is in the fellowship of another scripturally gathered assembly of Christians. Fellowship between local assemblies is based on conformity to the Word of God in faith and practice alone and not upon any man-made association or circle of fellowship. Separation from the world in its associations and ways is enjoined upon the saints (2 Cor. 6:14-18; I John 2:15-17). The headship of Christ is acknowledged in the church gatherings by the uncovered heads of the men, by the long hair, covered heads and silent participation of the women, and by a reverent attitude of all (1 Cor. 11:1-16; 14:34-35, 40). Gatherings of the local church are for the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, prayer, the ministry and study of the Word of God, the preaching of the gospel and for Sunday school activities. </p><h4>The Priesthood of All Believers</h4><p> We believe that all true Christians are constituted by God a “holy priesthood ” and as such are privileged to approach Him in worship (1 Peter 2:5; Heb. 10:19-22), which as God is a Spirit, must be in spirit and truth (John 4:24; Phil. 3:3). They are also made of God a “royal priesthood”, that they may serve Him, in showing forth the true virtues of the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:9). In their privileges of worship, all stand alike before God there being no such distinctions as “clergy” or &quot;laity&quot; known to the New Testament Scriptures, nor is there any Scriptural authority for the use of a divine title, such as “Reverend” by any man (Psa. 111:9; Matt. 23:8). We find in Scripture that while as to worship all are equal, yet in the service of the Lord and in the ministry of the Word each one has his own place and sphere. Women, for instance, who have an honorable sphere of service that no man can fill, are yet forbidden to take a public place in the preaching and teaching of the Word (I Cor. 14:34-36; l Tim. 2:11-12; Titus 2:3-5). </p><h4>Baptism and the Lord’s Supper</h4><p> We believe the Lord Jesus left for the obedience of His people two ordinances, memorial in character, which are to continue through the Church Age (Rom. 6:3-5; 1 Cor. 11:26); Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Baptism is by immersion in water, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19-20), showing our union with Christ in death and resurrection (Col. 2:11-12). The Lord’s Supper, when we partake together of the bread and wine, is symbolic of His body and His shed blood. We do this during his absence in remembrance of the Lord who died for us, looking forward, according to His promise, to His return. As often as we eat this bread and drink this cup, we do show the Lord&#39;s death till he come. This memorial feast is to be held weekly, -- on the first day of each week (Acts 20:7); -- and is for believers in the local assembly fellowship only. </p><h4>Satan, His Person, Work and Destiny</h4><p> We believe in the personality of Satan, as a real, active and malicious being, -- the arch enemy of God and man (Job 1:6; 1 Chron. 21:1; Zach. 3:1 ), who, having fallen from his state in which God created him (Isa. 14:12-19; Ezek. 28:11-19; 2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6), encompassed the ruin of our first parents (Gen. 3) and is now engaged in seeking to defeat God &#39;s purposes in the world and among His saints by all manner of subtle and diabolical devices (Matt. 13:19-25; 1 Peter 5:8). His judgment is that he shall be thrust into the bottomless abyss during the Millennial Age, and later to be cast into the Lake of Fire, forever (Rev. 20:1-10). </p><h4>Conscious Existence After Death</h4><p> We believe in the conscious and eternal punishment after death of the impenitent wicked (Psa. 9:17; Matt. 25:41; Mark 9:43-49; Luke 16:19-31). As the spirits of the righteous at death go to be with Christ in Heaven, they being “absent from the body and present with the Lord (Phil. 1:23; 2 Cor. 5:1-8; Acts 8:2), their bodies are left behind until Christ &#39;s second coming, when they will be raised from the dead incorruptible, reunited with their spirits, and so be &quot;forever with the Lord” (1 Cor. 15:51-57; 1 Thess. 4:14). In like manner, the spirits of those who die out of Christ, descent into Hell (Luke 16:22-23) their bodies being raised and reunited with their spirits, at the Great White Throne Judgement (Rev. 20:11-13), their eternal destiny from there being the Lake of Fire (Rev. 20:15; Rev. 21:8). In either case, the departed spirit, in the interval between death and resurrection, is not &quot;asleep&quot; -- the body alone being so spoken of (John 11:11) - - but fully conscious whether in bliss or woe. This solemn truth we consider of very grave importance affecting the foundations of the Faith and in view of the widespread effort of Satan to deny it we take our stand upon the Word of God in which we have the plain statements of the Lord Jesus and believe anyone holding or teaching non eternity of punishment should be denied a place in the fellowship of God&#39;s people (2 John 9:11) </p> </article> <!-- About --> <article id="location"> <h2 class="major">Location</h2> <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span> <p> We are located on 50, 5th Avenue in Pincourt, on the West of the Montreal Island. </p> <p> <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2802.430412175929!2d-73.99974468444535!3d45.380487779100065!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4cc94800b092603f%3A0x9094a9e288fcf14!2s50+5e+Avenue%2C+Pincourt%2C+QC+J7V+8E4!5e0!3m2!1sfr!2sca!4v1509925715904" width="100%" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen> </iframe> </p> </article> <!-- Schedule --> <article id="schedule"> <h2 class="major">Meeting Schedule</h2> <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> <ul style="text-align:left;"> <li> <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Sunday :</h4> 09:40 AM - 10:45 AM: Breaking of the Bread <br> 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Bible Study and Sunday School <br> 06:45 PM - 07:00 PM: Prayer Meeting <br> 07:00 PM - 08:00 PM: Message<br> </li> <li> <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Wednesday :</h4> 19:40 - 20:40: Prayer Meeting<br> </li> <li> <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Special Announcements :</h4> </li> </ul>
